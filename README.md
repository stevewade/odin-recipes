So far I have learned some essential Git commands, and some basic features of Github. I've also learned the basics of VSCode and some shortcuts.

I know how to create a basic HTML web page, why calling in index.html is important and what tags and elements are. I know how to use headings and add links and images to a page. The next step is to create a basic recipes website, inside this workspace.
